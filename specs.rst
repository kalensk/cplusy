people in world or irc cna give +1 or -1 to people

Example:
(5:02:03 PM) world: (bRy) brtokandon are good at finding nerds work
(5:02:50 PM) world: (TheFuzz) +1


TheFuzz gave bRy 1 point, since the +1 occured right after bRy said something.

The bad part about that is that people can game the system by just typing something and +1'ing themselves, so check that you can't give yourself a +1


Need ability to query people's stats and who gave what


*Ability to query the top 5 people who gave another person plus one's and their running count
